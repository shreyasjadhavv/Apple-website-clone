APPLE WEBSITE CLONE

Developed a clone of the Apple website using React and Material UI for a sleek, responsive design. For user authentication, I integrated AWS Cognito, an identity management service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS Cognito allows developers to easily add user authentication, sign-up, and login functionality to their web and mobile applications. This service handles user identity management securely, making the integration seamless.

The entire application was deployed using AWS Amplify, a powerful platform that simplifies the deployment of full-stack applications. AWS Amplify provides built-in CI/CD workflows that automate build and deployment processes, allowing for faster iterations during development. Additionally, its ready-made authentication components, like AWS Cognito, can be easily integrated into React applications, significantly speeding up the development process. This combination allowed us to focus on the front-end experience while utilizing AWS's robust backend services, saving time and effort in setting up custom authentication and deployment pipelines.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
